#Introducing new custom tags for making form validation easier and quick development.
<b>New tags and few classes are introduced here, let me explain all of these one by one.</b>

1. &lt;new-h1&gt; The very first tag, similar to &lt;h1&gt; in HTML but differs in UI, this will provide you the best suitable interphase for a good UI, if you will put any content inside it, followed by its closing tag then the color of the content will change every second upto infinity.
2. class="b1 to b9", 9 new classes to use for any div, a new background pattern will be provided to the div which will have any class from b1 to b9.
3. id="new-back-1" Similarly for the background of the page you have to assign "new-back-1" id to body and there are 9 id's for that, same as the class. And these varies from "new-back-1" to "new-back-9".
4. &lt;new-text&gt; what it does, is similar to that of the &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;, but it is with strong HTML5 validations already, so anyone can use it inside a form tag.
5. &lt;new-password&gt; what it does, is similar to that of the &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; /&gt;, but it is with strong HTML5 validations already, so anyone can use it inside a form tag.
6. &lt;new-passconfirm&gt; what it does, is similar to that of the &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; /&gt;, but it is with strong HTML5 validations already and matches the password with &lt;new-password&gt; tag. so anyone can use it inside a form tag to get the frequent output with strong form validations.
7. &lt;new-search&gt; what it does, is similar to that of the &lt;input type=&quot;search&quot; /&gt;, but it is with strong HTML5 validations already, so anyone can use it inside a form tag.
8. &lt;new-submit&gt; what it does, is similar to that of the &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;, but it is with strong HTML5 validations already, so anyone can use it inside a form tag.
9. &lt;new-select-input&gt; The most interesting and powerful tag introduced here is this one. you do not need to write select and options for each, just write values to be assigned to the options seperated by comma (eg: 1,2,3,4) and close the tag then. You will automatically provided a select tag with datalist, in which you can select and type as well. Also it has strong HTML5 validations inside a form tag.
10. &lt;new-email&gt; what it does, is similar to that of the &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; /&gt;, but it is with strong HTML5 validations already, so anyone can use it inside a form tag.
11. &lt;new-url&gt; what it does, is similar to that of the &lt;input type=&quot;url&quot; /&gt;, but it is with strong HTML5 validations already, so anyone can use it inside a form tag.
12. &lt;new-url&gt; what it does, is similar to that of the &lt;input type=&quot;phone&quot; /&gt;, but it is with strong HTML5 validations already, so anyone can use it inside a form tag. Also it does pattern matching for a phone number and restricts fake phone numbers thus.

<b>Note: All these tags which are introduced for form tags has a limitation for now, and compatible for Google chrome for now. we have future scope for these all and hopefully we upgrade it soon with no more limitations on them. But for now they have some limitations and you can't use any tag on the same page again except Classes and ID's for background change of a div or the body, Also you can use &lt;new-h1&gt; multiple times in a page.</b>
